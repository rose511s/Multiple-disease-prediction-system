# Multiple-disease-prediction-system
This project is used to detect multiple diseases like diabetes, parkinsons and heart disease prediction and is a machine learning based project where various algorithms of ml are used like SVC, Logistic Regression.

->Spearheaded a machine learning initiative for the early detection of diabetes, Parkinson's, and heart disease, employing sophisticated algorithms such as Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Logistic Regression to analyze patient datasets and deliver actionable predictive insights.

->Implemented advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, coupled with rigorous model evaluation and validation, to optimize prediction accuracy, while collaborating with healthcare professionals to ensure the clinical relevance and practical application of the model outcomes.




#how to run the project
